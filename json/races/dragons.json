All drakona have thick scales that provide excellent natural armor against both attacks and the forces of nature. They are large in size, ranging from 5 feet to 7 feet on average, with long sharp teeth. New teeth grow throughout a Drakona\u2019s approximately 350-year lifespan, so they are never in danger of permanently losing an incisor. Unlike their dragon ancestors, drakona don\u2019t have wings and can\u2019t fly without magical aid. Members of this ancestry pass down the element of their breath through generations, though in rare cases, a drakona\u2019s elemental power will differ from the rest of their family\u2019s.<br><\/p>","is_private":0,"tooltip":null,"is_template":null,"is_attributes_private":0,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"created_at":"2025-08-10T18:35:04.000000Z","updated_at":"2025-08-12T17:00:34.000000Z","created_by":218702,"updated_by":218702,"image_path":null,"image_uuid":"9f9e32a1-61a0-4932-b8de-a78f7092a582","header_image":null,"header_uuid":null,"marketplace_uuid":null},"pivotLocations":[]}
