By and large, the dwarves worship the what you and I know as the [note:6861837|Old Norse Gods]<\/li><li><b>Gnomes<\/b> - They tend to live in forest and in rocky forbidding places preferring isolation to being bullied and pestered. Those who do venture out into the bigger world are peculiarly secure in their own skins and make good adventuring companions known for their prudence and adventuring spirits in equal measure. [<i>Need some lore, we can make it together<\/i>] I'm inclined to give the gnomes the [note:6862012|Old Gaellic gods]\u00a0and this would give the Gnomes some common grounds with the people of [location:6821563]<\/li><li><b>Half Elves<\/b> - Have to work hard building community because each half seems to think of them as the worst of both parts.
