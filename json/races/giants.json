Adult giants range from 6 \u00bd to 8 \u00bd feet tall and are naturally muscular, regardless of body type. They are easily recognized by their wide frames and elongated arms and necks. Though they can have up to three eyes, all giants are born with none and remain sightless for their first year of life. Until a giant reaches the age of 10 and their features fully develop, the formation of their eyes may fluctuate. Those with a single eye are commonly known as cyclops. The average giant lifespan is about 75 years.<\/p><p>They live in the north and are creatures of legend to the people of Kashal.<\/p>","is_private":0,"tooltip":null,"is_template":null,"is_attributes_private":0,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"created_at":"2025-08-10T18:42:33.000000Z","updated_at":"2025-08-12T16:56:53.000000Z","created_by":218702,"updated_by":218702,"image_path":null,"image_uuid":"9f9e3150-c543-4a52-bb47-1d371fc00793","header_image":null,"header_uuid":null,"marketplace_uuid":null},"pivotLocations":[]}
