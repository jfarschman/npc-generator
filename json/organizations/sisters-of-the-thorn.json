They are bound by oath to the [character:6815195|Thane], the druidess who serves as both spiritual leader and guardian of the region, and they see themselves as extensions of her will. \u00a0Each Sister is a master of woodcraft, skilled in tracking, hunting, and survival. They move silently through the trees, blending seamlessly with the shadows and undergrowth, becoming nearly invisible to those who do not know their ways.<\/p><p>The Sisters are known for their stoicism and unwavering loyalty. They are chosen for their discipline, resourcefulness, and unwavering commitment to their duty. While they are not necessarily grim or humorless, they are focused and serious when on patrol or in defense of their lands. \u00a0They hold the sanctity of the forest above all else, and they are swift and merciless in their judgment of those who would defile it. \u00a0Outsiders who treat the forest with respect are generally left unmolested, but those who trespass with ill intent, whether they be poachers, loggers, or invaders, will face the swift and deadly wrath of the Thorn.<\/p><p>Relationship with the Thane: The Sisters of the Thorn hold the Thane in the highest regard, viewing her not only as their leader but also as a conduit of the forest's spirit. They are fiercely protective of her and would lay down their lives without hesitation to defend her or the lands she protects. \u00a0Their bond is both professional and deeply personal, forged in shared experiences and a common devotion to the forest's well-being.<\/p><p>Friends of the Sisters know these words and a Sister will know them by they way they are spoken:<\/p><p>They whispered to her, \"You cannot withstand the storm.\" -- \"I am the storm.\" is the reply.<\/p>","is_private":0,"tooltip":null,"is_template":null,"is_attributes_private":0,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"created_at":"2025-01-30T15:53:25.000000Z","updated_at":"2025-01-30T16:26:26.000000Z","created_by":218702,"updated_by":218702,"image_path":null,"image_uuid":"9e17e37e-d4c0-4d59-9a4a-9ee6ed144ed1","header_image":null,"header_uuid":null,"marketplace_uuid":null,"mentions":[{"entity_id":7227136,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":6821563},{"entity_id":7227136,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":6815195}]},"members":[{"id":815628,"organisation_id":344932,"character_id":1730472,"role":null,"created_at":"2025-01-30T16:05:12.000000Z","updated_at":"2025-01-30T16:05:12.000000Z","is_private":0,"pin_id":null,"status_id":0,"parent_id":null},{"id":815630,"organisation_id":344932,"character_id":1848255,"role":"Little Brother","created_at":"2025-01-30T16:14:31.000000Z","updated_at":"2025-01-30T16:39:31.000000Z","is_private":0,"pin_id":null,"status_id":0,"parent_id":815633},{"id":815633,"organisation_id":344932,"character_id":1848273,"role":"Leader","created_at":"2025-01-30T16:22:38.000000Z","updated_at":"2025-01-30T16:38:06.000000Z","is_private":0,"pin_id":null,"status_id":0,"parent_id":815628},{"id":815636,"organisation_id":344932,"character_id":1848290,"role":"Scout","created_at":"2025-01-30T16:31:13.000000Z","updated_at":"2025-01-30T16:37:51.000000Z","is_private":0,"pin_id":null,"status_id":0,"parent_id":815633},{"id":815637,"organisation_id":344932,"character_id":1848296,"role":"Wisdom","created_at":"2025-01-30T16:38:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2025-01-30T16:38:45.000000Z","is_private":0,"pin_id":null,"status_id":0,"parent_id":815633}],"pivotLocations":[{"location_id":1523771}]}
